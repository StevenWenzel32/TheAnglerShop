The Angler Shop is a mod designed to give the angler a shop that sells fishing-related items along with fishing quest reward items.

This mod was inspired and based on Angler Shops Alternative made by Champygnakx who used Angler Shop by NotLe0n for the base of his mod.
Credit for the idea and most of the code goes to Champygnakx and NotLe0n.

Aside from what is already found in the Angler Shops Alternative mod, the description can be found here: -- add a link here --- 

Hardmode items like Fin Wings and Hotline Fishing Hook are only available once in hardmode - just like fishing quest rewards.

If you still like to complete quests but also want to be able to buy the items, you can toggle a setting in the mod Conig.
This will enable a custom currency that the Angler shop uses and which you can get by completing fishing quests (1-4 per quest).

*1) This mod adds a few vanilla items that were missing from the shop:
- Lava absorbant sponge
- Bottomless lava bucket
- Bottomless Shimmer bucket
- Magic Conch
- Demon Conch

*2) Adds a fishing quest counter to the Angler's dialogue box showing how many quests have been completed

*3) Adds a 3rd shop that sells normal fish that are used to make food or are meant for selling
	- There is an optional setting in the mod configuration menu to turn on progression unlocking of the fish the angler sells. These fish would be locked behind any boss progression
or other restrictions present in the vanilla version and would also have to be discovered/fished up by the player at least once to be available in the shop.

*4) Adds a 4th shop that sells fish used in spells.
	- This shop also will follow the progression option if it's turned on in the mod configuration menu, meaning that fish will be locked until discovered/fished up by the player 
	at least once.
	
*5) Adds a 5th shop that sells bag/drop fish and crates. This is an optional shop and can be turned off in the mod configuration menu
	- If the progression setting is turned on the items in this shop will also be locked until discovered/fished up by the player at least once
	- works with calamity-stuffed fish 
	- might not work with other mods
	
*6) Gives the option to turn off time delays on fishing quests. This means you can complete more than 1 quest a day!!

*7) Gives the option for trophies/rewards for fishing quest milestones
	- reward at 10 completed 
	- bigger reward at 50
	- crazy reward at 200
	etc.
	
*8) Gives the option for an announcement to show in the game chat when a new fishing quest is ready

*9) This is a list of all the new items added to the game
	- fishing nets - 3 tiers - credit goes to <add name here> *********************
	- Multi-lure accessory - adds more lures at any fishing pole being used
	- create chance buff accessory - increases chances of fishing up crates
	- auto fishing accessory - has multiple tiers allowing different levels of auto fishing - for those who want to save their money or still want to grind
	- The Leech - Sword - a reward from completing X fishing quests - has crazy life steal abilities 
	- More fish-related weapons and items to come!
